<!-- Optional: Add here a short description of the feature, if you feel like ticket title is not
enough. Don't put a lot here, details should be in the 'What' section below. -->

## Why?

<!-- This section is for the context: Describe the problem you want to solve, the need motivating
the feature you're proposing. Add some context. -->

## What?

<!-- This section is for describing the external interface impacts. For example, for CLI, consider
describing the expected new command(s). For GUI, consider adding mockups of the desired
interface. **Give examples of usage.**

You don't know what to put here? It's OK. Let's talk and iterate until solution is clear. -->

## How?

<!-- This section is for describing internal interface impacts. Typically, any change in a 
module API which is not part of the external interfaces mentioned above should be listed here. Some
implementation choices may be given here as well.

You don't know what to put here? It's OK. Just drop some ideas if you have on how to solve the
problem and let's talk and iterate until solution is clear. -->
