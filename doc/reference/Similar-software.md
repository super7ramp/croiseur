## Reference: Similar Software

Croiseur is not the only crossword generator and editor. A lot of small software exist in this area,
more or less advanced. Here is a non-comprehensive list.

### Free Software

- [CrossShare](https://github.com/crosshare-org/crosshare): A web application for both constructors
  and players. Requires a Google account for construction.
- [Crossword Composer](https://github.com/paulgb/crossword-composer): A small web-based crossword
  filler. Its solver is integrated in Croiseur.
- [CrosswordEditor](https://crosswordeditor.sourceforge.net/): An interesting Java Swing
  application for editing crosswords. No automatic filling of the grid.
- [cwc](https://cwordc.sourceforge.net/): A command-line crossword compiler, written in C++. First
  version dates from 1999 and still works!
- [GNOME Crossword Editor](https://gitlab.gnome.org/jrb/crosswords): Under development but already
  very polished. Comes also with a player mode. Only works on Linux.
- [Qxw](https://www.quinapalus.com/qxw.html): Fast, stable and with an extensive set of features. UI
  is aging though - it still uses the old GTK 2 library. Works on Linux and Windows.
- [Palabra](https://github.com/svisser/palabra): An interesting Python application for editing
  crosswords. No automatic filling of the grid.
- [Phil](https://github.com/keiranking/Phil): An impressive crossword maker web application.

  puzzle generator and editor.

  in Python.

  Rust. Its solver is integrated in Croiseur.

### Non-Free Software

- [Crossword Compiler](https://www.crossword-compiler.com/): Looks very complete. Only works
  on Windows.
- [Crossword Studio](https://www.crossword-studio.com/): Only works on Windows and macOS.
- [Ingrid](https://ingrid.cx): Polished editor, currently in beta. Works on Window, macOS and
  Linux (looks like an Electron app). Free to download but its licence is unclear.
  Both [its core and command-line interface](https://github.com/rf-/ingrid_core) are under a free
  licence though.
