## crosswords

**crosswords** is a software tool to generate crossword problems. It embeds dictionaries for 
multiple language as well as several solvers. It is designed to be extensible: Solvers, 
dictionaries and even user interfaces can be added as plugins.

As a crossword enthusiast, you may be interested in creating your crossword with 
[**crosswords-gui**](crosswords-gui), a desktop application based on **crosswords**.

As a command-line fan, you may be interested in [**crosswords-cli**](crosswords-cli), a CLI 
to **crosswords**.

As a problem solver, you may be interested in discovering how [the solvers](crosswords-solver) work.
