## crosswords-dictionary-hunspell-codec

`crosswords-dictionary-hunspell-codec` is a library which allows to read Hunspell dictionaries and 
generate all word forms from them.

Note that the library has a lot of rough edges and does not support all the dictionary options 
yet; Valid dictionaries may fail to be read by this library.
