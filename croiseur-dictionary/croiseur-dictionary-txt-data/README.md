## croiseur-dictionary-txt-data

This folder contains dictionaries in simple text format readable by
the [crossword text dictionary plugin](../croiseur-dictionary-txt-plugin).

### Where to find missing wordlists?

Some folders only contain a dictionary description and not the actual wordlist: This is because the referenced
dictionary is missing a licence indicating it can be freely distributed.

These dictionaries can retrieved manually by user
from [Peter Broda's website](https://peterbroda.me/crosswords/wordlist/lists_by_publisher.html) and
copy-paste in the dictionary path: They will be automatically found by croiseur thanks to the existing dictionary
descriptions.
