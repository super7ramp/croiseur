## Hi there 🖖

**Croiseur** is first a hobby project to explore crossword generation algorithms and some software
architecture ideas. Contributions are welcome though!

Here is a non-comprehensive list where help would be particularly appreciated.

### As a User 🙋

#### Report Bugs

Three steps:

1. Find a bug.
2. Check if the bug does not already exist in
   the [bug tracker](https://gitlab.com/super7ramp/croiseur/-/issues).
3. Report the bug in the bug tracker. Please follow the `bug` template when filling the ticket.

#### Suggest a Feature

Submit a new issue in the [bug tracker](https://gitlab.com/super7ramp/croiseur/-/issues), following
the `feature` template.

### As a Software Developer 🧑‍💻

#### Add new Features

Croiseur is designed to be extensible. It means that
new [service implementations](doc/reference/Available-service-providers.md) such as a new
crossword solver or a new puzzle codec can be easily added.

Check the how-to guides in the [documentation](doc/README.md) to get started.

#### Fix Bugs

If you have found a bug *and* you see how to fix
it, [go ahead](https://gitlab.com/super7ramp/croiseur/-/merge_requests/new)!

### As a Translator 🧑‍🏫

As a translator, you may want to translate Croiseur in your own language. Unfortunately, translation
files are scattered across various modules and translation documentation is missing. For the bravest
ones only!

Additionally, you might want to check the existing dictionaries for invalid words
and [report them](#report-bugs) – given the current dictionary generation process, there must be
some.

### Cheers!
